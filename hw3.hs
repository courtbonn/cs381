--Exercise 3

--Part a) f x y = if null x then [y] else x
--        g x y = if not (null x) then [] else [y]

-- (1) What are the types of f and g?
-- f :: [a] -> a -> [a] 
-- g :: a -> b -> [b]

-- (2) Explain why the functions have these types.
--F takes in a list of x and a value y and returns a list. 
--G takes in two values x and y and returns either an empty list or a list of values. 

-- (3) Which type is more general? 
--G is more general because x and y can be two different types since they don't relate to each other and it can return an empty list.
--F requires x and y to be the same type. 

-- (4) Why do f and g have different types? 
--Because f can return both x and [y], x and y have to be the same type otherwise a type error will occur. 
--G is different because x and y don't have to be the same type since they don't relate to each other. 

--Part b) 
--h :: [b] -> [(a,b)] -> [b]
h b a = map snd a ++ b

--Part c) 
--k :: (a -> b) -> ((a -> b) -> a) -> b
k x y = (x (y (x)))

--Part d) Can you define a function of type a -> b?
--c :: a -> b
--c a =
